The recent rise in Chinaâ€™s smartphone adoption rate has resulted in a large amount of mobile
data available, leading to the possibility of developing data-driven marketing techniques. This
study aims to fill in the gap between state-of-the-art analytic frameworks and existing
research for mobile application market in China. Specifically, we investigated the
TalkingData data released in Kaggle Challenge and conducted user profiling using K-means
algorithm. Based on the user profiles, an App Recommender System was constructed using
the Apriori algorithm. Attribution analysis was conducted using Logistic regression. Finally,
we made prediction on application installation rate for mobile device models.
